Here are 15 user stories for the **Lily’s Florist** web application, structured to help you—as a developer—break down the project into manageable tasks.

I have categorized them into **Customer Experience (Storefront)** and **Business Operations (Admin/Backend)** to match your workflow as a full-stack developer.

### **Category 1: Customer Experience (Storefront)**

**1. Browse Visual Gallery**

> **As a** potential customer,
> **I want** to browse a high-quality photo gallery of bouquets, centerpieces, and event work,
> **So that** I can get inspiration and see the quality of Lily’s work before buying.

**2. Filter by Occasion & Season**

> **As a** customer,
> **I want** to filter products by occasion (e.g., Birthday, Sympathy) or season (e.g., Spring, Valentine’s),
> **So that** I can quickly find the appropriate arrangement for my specific need.

**3. Delivery or Pickup Selection**

> **As a** customer,
> **I want** to select between "Delivery" or "In-Store Pickup" before I proceed to checkout,
> **So that** I know if the service is available for my location or schedule.

**4. Schedule Delivery Date & Time**

> **As a** customer,
> **I want** to select a specific delivery date and a preferred time slot during checkout,
> **So that** I can ensure the flowers arrive exactly when the recipient is available (e.g., for a birthday or event).

**5. Personalization (Card Message)**

> **As a** customer,
> **I want** to input recipient details and write a custom card message attached to the order,
> **So that** the gift feels personal and the recipient knows who sent it.

**6. Secure Guest & Account Checkout**

> **As a** customer,
> **I want** the option to checkout as a guest for speed, or log in to save my details,
> **So that** I can complete my purchase quickly without forced registration, but have the option to save time later.

**7. Loyalty Program Integration**

> **As a** repeat customer,
> **I want** to see my loyalty points balance and apply them for a discount at checkout,
> **So that** I feel rewarded for my continued business with Lily’s Florist.

**8. Order History & Reordering**

> **As a** registered customer,
> **I want** to view my past orders and easily click "Reorder",
> **So that** I can quickly send the same arrangement to a recurring recipient (like a spouse or parent) without searching for it again.

**9. Custom Event Inquiry**

> **As a** wedding or corporate client,
> **I want** to fill out a contact form specifically for custom events,
> **So that** I can start a conversation about a large order that requires a separate invoice.

**10. Read Seasonal Tips (Blog)**

> **As a** site visitor,
> **I want** to read blog posts about flower care and seasonal stories,
> **So that** I can learn how to make my bouquet last longer and feel connected to the florist's expertise.

### **Category 2: Business Operations (Admin & Backend)**

**11. Centralized Order Dashboard**

> **As** Lily (Shop Owner),
> **I want** to view all incoming orders (from the web, phone, or walk-ins) in a single dashboard,
> **So that** I stop "juggling" multiple lists and ensure no order is missed during busy rushes.

**12. Automated Inventory Tracking**

> **As** Lily (Shop Owner),
> **I want** the website to automatically deduct stock (flowers, vases, add-ons) when an online order is placed,
> **So that** I don't accidentally sell items I don't have, preventing shortages during holidays.

**13. Content Management for Seasonal Updates**

> **As** Lily (Shop Owner),
> **I want** an easy way to upload new photos to the gallery and update the "Seasonal Specials" section,
> **So that** the site always looks fresh and reflects what is currently growing/available without needing code changes.

**14. Automated Email Confirmations**

> **As** Lily (Shop Owner),
> **I want** the system to automatically send an order confirmation email to the customer with their order summary and delivery date,
> **So that** customers are reassured their order was received, reducing the need for them to call the shop to check.

**15. Promotional Tools**

> **As** Lily (Shop Owner),
> **I want** to create and manage discount codes (e.g., "MOTHER10") for holidays,
> **So that** I can drive sales during peak times and track the effectiveness of my social media promotions.
